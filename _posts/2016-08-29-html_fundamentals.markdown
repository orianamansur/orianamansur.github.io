I am currently working through HTML/CSS fundamentals and although I've noticed searching on google that there are a lot of other tags that one could use for web development, I feel that with the information already provided in the lessons, there are so many different kinds of website I could create. 

I am starting to see how it all fits together and I'm excited to learn more languages, such as JavaScript and Rails, to use them all together, with my imagination, to create my own websites.
