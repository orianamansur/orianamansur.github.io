I am still an undergaduate student, and although I am majoring in Politics (which I am very passionate about), as I approach my senior year I am still very much undecided as to what career I'd like to pursue once I graduate. 
Life is too short and I really do want to end up with a life working in a typical 9-5 job in a quiet office space, in a field that I might like but without ever know whether there is one I might be much more passionate about. 

I have a strong desire to learn; without trying sounding pretentious, I've had gone learning piano to learning 18th century French literature, to Egyptian hieroglyphics and just a number of other random topics that I initially knew close to nothing about. So, the reason I decided to learn to code not is only because it really does have such a huge impact on our lives (which is why I think everybody should learn to code), but I am also exciting by the abilty to create new and groundbreaking things with all the endless opportunities for both individual and collective empowerment that programing brings. 

Ialso see learning to code as not just the learning languages themselves, but also learning to adopt a new way of thinking in solving problems, on that is both strategic and with logic but entirely creative way. This, learning web development will not present so many possibilities, I will also come out having learning a very important way of thinking stratetigcally that can apply to many other things. 

I'm very excited to learn!
